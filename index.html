                        Mega Pet is a website where the main function is to advertise pet shelters
                        adoption of pets, in order to reach more people and thus
                        way to contribute to fewer homeless animals. On the other hand we know that
                        hostels often go through money problems so they can't always
                        pay for the maintenance of pets, therefore a function has been added
                        with which the adopters could donate money and implements that would allow the
                        shelters subsist in a better way. We are Megapet!

                    Within what is expected with this website is the increase in pet adoptions, in turn
                    that hostels have a range of reach greater than they would have without using the web. We wait
                    that the web be recognized as a trusted site where hostels can publish the
                    pets in need. In this way, plan to help eliminate animal abandonment, since
                    According to the information we were able to find, it is too common to see very badly injured animals.
                    or abandoned on the streets. Finally, it should be emphasized that "MegaPet" is an undertaking without
                    for profit which only seek to combat animal abandonment.
